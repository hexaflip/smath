***A logarithmic way to learn math using python***

# Overview
In this program you simply start the game and doing math problems, you will be tested on the the accuracy at which you solve and the speed. The faster and more accurate the higher your level goes. You will improve fast at first, but as the problems get more difficult your imporvement will most likely not be at the same pace. So, that is why the program is designed to help you grow to an extent. Everybody learns at a different pace so it's obviously not going to be the best for everybody, but feel free to give it a shot!

# Calculating XP and Levels
I used [Jake Lee's](https://blog.jakelee.co.uk/converting-levels-into-xp-vice-versa/) way of calculating XP. I decided to go with the following formula after reading his blog:
\$ L $ = Level

 XP \$ = \(level/0.07)^â…”$ + log(\$L$)
